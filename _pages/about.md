<p>I'm Sean O'Connor, a nontraditional student studying Computer Science at Pomona College.  After growing up in rural Vermont, I spent 5 years in Detroit as an Emergency Medical Technician, working on some of the country's busiest ambulances.  EMS was both an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience; one footnote is when I won an award for rescuing a woman whose car launched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/2017/08/18/man-partially-ejected-through-sunroof-killed-in-rollover-crash-on-fenkell-ave-in-detroit/">into the second story of a building</a>.</p>

<p>In 2019, I left EMS, moved to SoCal and started studying CS.  Like EMS, I've found CS both challenging and rewarding.  After my first year of classes, I spent the summer researching the User Interface design of California Consumer Privacy Act "Don't Sell My Personal Info" opt-outs and wrote a <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07884">paper</a> on the results.  I followed this research up by creating a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oapostrophe/Who-sSellingMyInfo-">browser extension</a> that detects pages selling personal information and helps California users opt out.</p>

<p>This past year, I've branched out to explore different areas of CS.  I worked (remotely) as a teaching assistant for the college's introductory CS class, where I helped redesign the teaching of areas like recursion that many students struggled with to make them more accessible.  I also spent the Spring as a research assistant in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc/arcslab/">Autonomous Robotics and Complex Systems lab</a>, where I created a browser <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oapostrophe/arms2">tool</a> to simplify writing verbose XML-based robotics simulation languages.  Last semester, I combined my EMS background with CS by researching the use of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oapostrophe/HeartNet">neural networks</a> to automatically detect heart attacks in 12-lead EKG images.</p>

<p>This summer, I'll be exploring the software development industry as an intern at Indeed.  I'm currently living in Seattle with my partner Theo and our dog Stella.  When I'm not coding, I've been roller-blading around the city, making art, and learning modern dance.</p>

<p>I'd love to chat about my projects, my experience as a non-traditional CS student, or anything else!  If you're thinking about or currently studying CS, I'd also be happy to answer any questions and offer advice / mentorship on your journey.  Just send a message my way.  Thanks for reading!</p>
