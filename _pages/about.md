<p>I'm Sean O'Connor, a rising senior studying Computer Science at Pomona College.  After growing up in rural Vermont, I spent 5 years in Emergency Medical Services in Detroit, on some of the busiest ambulances in the country.  I faced some enormous challenges and had incredibly rewarding experiences as an EMT; I even won an award for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/2017/08/18/man-partially-ejected-through-sunroof-killed-in-rollover-crash-on-fenkell-ave-in-detroit/">this call where I rescued a woman whose car launched into the second story of a building and landed on its roof on the ground.

In 2019, I transitioned to studying Computer Science at Pomona.  I spent a summer researching the User Interface design of California Consumer Privacy Act "Don't Sell My Info" opt-outs, writing a <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07884">paper</a> on the results.  I followed this research up by creating a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oapostrophe/Who-sSellingMyInfo-">browser extension</a> that detects pages selling personal information and helps California users opt out.

This past year, I've branched out to different areas of CS.  I worked (remotely) as a teaching assistant for the college's introductory CS class, where I helped redesign the curriculum to make it more accessible in areas many students were struggling with.  I also spent the Spring as a research assistant in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc/arcslab/">Autonomous Robotics and Complex Systems lab</a>, where I created a browser-based <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oapostrophe/arms2">tool</a> to simplify writing verbose XML-based robotics simulation languages.  Last semester, I combined my EMS background with CS by creating a <a target="_blank" href=https://github.com/oapostrophe/HeartNet">"neural network-based tool</a> to research automatically detecting heart attacks in 12-lead EKG images.

This summer, I'll be exploring the software development industry as an intern at Indeed.  I currently live in Seattle with my artistically talented partner Theo and our dog Stella.  When I'm not coding, I've been roller-blading around the city, painting, and learning modern dance.

<p>You can reach me by <a target="_blank" href="mailto:swow2015@mymail.pomona.edu">email</a> or on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-o-connor-11b193b3/">LinkedIn</a>.  If you're trying to build on one of my projects, feel free to email me with questions or submit an issue on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.

I'd love to chat about my projects, my experience as a non-traditional CS student, or anything else!  If you're thinking about or currently studying CS, I'd also be happy to answer any questions and offer advice / mentorship on your journey.

I'm graduating in Spring 2022, and would be interested in hearing about any full-time job opportunities starting after that time period.  So if you know of something that you think might be a good fit, definitely send a message my way!  Thanks for reading!</p>
