<p>I'm Sean O'Connor, a nontraditional student studying Computer Science at Pomona College.  After growing up in rural Vermont, I spent 5 years in Detroit as an Emergency Medical Technician, working on the busiest ambulances in the country.  EMS was both an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience; one footnote is when I won an award for rescuing a woman whose car launched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/2017/08/18/man-partially-ejected-through-sunroof-killed-in-rollover-crash-on-fenkell-ave-in-detroit/">into the second story of a building</a>.</p>

<p>In 2019, I left EMS, moved to SoCal and started my CS journey.  Like EMS, I've found CS both challenging and rewarding.  After my first year of classes, I spent the summer researching the User Interface design of California Consumer Privacy Act "Don't Sell My Personal Info" opt-outs.  I wrote a <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07884">paper</a> on the results, which I followed up by creating a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oapostrophe/Who-sSellingMyInfo-">browser extension</a> that detects pages selling the user's information and helps them opt out.</p>

<p>This past year, I've branched out to explore different areas of CS.  I worked (remotely) as a teaching assistant for the college's introductory CS class, where after noticing topics like recursion that many students struggle with, I helped redesign how they are taught to make them more accessible.  I also spent the Spring as a research assistant in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc/arcslab/">Autonomous Robotics and Complex Systems lab</a>, where I created a browser <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oapostrophe/arms2">tool</a> to simplify writing verbose XML-based robotics simulation languages.  Last semester, I combined my EMS background with CS by researching the use of neural networks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oapostrophe/HeartNet">automatically detect heart attacks</a> in images of 12-lead Electrocardiograms.</p>

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/heartnet.png" alt="The heartnet app I created for classifying EKGs" /><br><i>The application I created to detect heart attack in EKG images.</i></p>

<p>This summer, I'm exploring the software development industry as an intern at Indeed.  I'm currently living in Seattle with my partner Theo and our dog Stella.  When I'm not working, I've been roller-blading around the city, making art, and learning modern dance.</p>

<p>I'd love to chat about my projects, my experience as a non-traditional CS student, or anything else!  Just send a message my way.  Thanks for reading!</p>
